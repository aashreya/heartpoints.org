How many times have you hesitated and then kept on going when coming across someone in need in the streets of
San Francisco? You feel the need and responsibility to help but pulling money out of your wallet on the spot seems
risky. Moreover, you have no guarantee on how the money would be spent, whether or not it would contribute to the
well-being of the person to whom you gave it.

Heartpoints.org tackles this problem by enabling wireless 1-on-1 donations in the form of heartpoints which can be
used to obtain basic services such as food, clothes and shelter from participating vendors around the city. The people
wishing to receive donations carry a tile emitting a signal that makes individual wireless donations possible via the
heartpoints.org mobile app. This approach makes everyday donations more appealing to a wider group of people and
satisfies the need of knowing who benefits from the donations and how.
